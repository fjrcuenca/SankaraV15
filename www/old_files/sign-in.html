          <h3>Sankara Eye</h3>
			<p>
				By 1982, the activities of Sri Kanchi Kamakoti Medical Trust had grown very diverse and grown well. 
				At this juncture, the Acharyas advised Dr.Ramani to establish Sri Kanchi Kamakoti Medical Trust, 
				exclusively to oversee health activities. A board of Trustees were appointed and have continued to 
				guide its activities, ever since. 
			</p>
			<p>
				In 1985, a new chapter in the history of the trust was waiting to be born: under the leadership of 
				Dr. Ramani and the persuasion and deep commitment of many doctors, especially Dr. S.Balasubramaniam, 
				the idea of focusing on a specialised area of medical care emerged. The incidences of preventable and 
				curable blindness in India was very high during the 1980s and there was much that could be done. 
			</p>
			<p>
				Naturally, the 10*10 sq.ft.clinic would not do for such a lofty dream; Providence would not have it 
				that way either. A good friend of Dr. Ramani, ShriNatraj came forward and donated 5.5 acres of land 
				in Sivanandapuram, in Saravanampatty area of Coimbatore. Back then, this area was a remote hamlet, 
				very unlike the buzzing IT centre that it has become today. The entire land was covered in Parthenium and
				far removed from the rest of the city. Again, help came in the form of friends. Soon, a fencing was erected 
				around the land and coconut trees were planted alongside the fence. A bore well was also sunk and on another
				side of the fence, avenue trees were planted as well. The residential quarters in the hospital premises 
				were lined with suitable plants as well. 
			</p>
			<p>
				Construction of the hospital that was to be named Sankara Eye Hospital was yet to begin. This is when 
				Dr. S.V. Balasubramaniam, both a visionary and philanthropist came forward to donate a Toyota van and 
				construct a 1000 sq.feet consultation centre - Vedanayagam centre within the premises. The van was used 
				for the Trust's outreach programmes. From that beginning, there was no looking back. To the team at 
				Sankara, Eye Care was going to be a long-term mission. Therefore, every facet of construction â€“ be it 
				the 10 feet wide corridors, the H-type architecture that segregates outpatient care from diagnostics and 
				inpatient care, paving way for natural light to come in, or demarcating the support activities such
				as the canteen and purchase areas from the main hospital, were planned, keeping the future in mind. 
				The architecture and construction remains relevant even today.
